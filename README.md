# Movie recommendation algorithmns

## Rationale
Online video providers, such as Netflix and Amazon, rely heavily on efficient movie recommendation systems to suggest relevant movies to their users. This is important to
maintain customer engagement and interest in the service, as the sheer number of choices available can be overwhelming. Manier times consumers are clueless as to what to watch and recommendation engines come handy during these kind of situations.

## Objective
Attempt to determine the best approach to movie recommendations by building different recommendation systems using small
movielens data provided by GroupLens Research. The models we investigate include Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), K-Nearest Neighbors, Co-Clustering and a Neural Network Approach. By training these models on 100,000 ratings data points from the MovieLens dataset, we aim to identify what makes a strong recommendation model and how to achieve it.
